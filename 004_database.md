data base
=========

a database is useful so developers can make sure that when a web server restarts,
all the important user infos are not lost.

databases let the web developer store all sorts of datas: time stamps, numbers,
words, or even unstructured data liek JSON. developers like to store things like
user IDs, user emails, user credit card numbers and other things in the database.

when saving user credit cards, it is very important to do it right. so make
sure to google (and read) a whole bunch before starting.

also, very importantly, a data base lets the developer find data. because a web
site can hold a lot of user datas, it is important to be able to find it
quickly, so the users aren't waiting to find out other users info. 

there are a few database types: big ones, and bigger ones. 100 years ago,
holding information about a 100 million people was a big deal and only
governments or large companies could do it. today, it is easy to keep track of
whole countries' worth of information. sometimes, though, a web site wants to
keep track of many countries worth of information. in those cases, it is very
important to use bigger and more database servers.
