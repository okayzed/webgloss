mail servers
============

when web sites want to get in touch with their users they have to use the email
system. since the mail system is complex to navigate, many private enterprises
make a business out of helping the e-mail flow across the internet.

if you don't want to use a private company or can't afford one, you can set up
your own mail server. as long as you have an static IP (and a forgiving ISP),
it's possible to join the federation of mail servers. to be part of the federation,
you'll have to spend time monitoring your server and making sure it obeys the rules.

in return, your server can send email bits anywhere (kind of).


sending emails
--------------

building an email is easy: just specify a list of users and go. except when
there are millions of users. in which case, you probably just look like a spam
bot. in this case, you need to defer to an external party who knows what they are doing.

receipts & tracking GIFs
-------------

in organizations, they sometimes mandate that emails have receipts (kind of
like postage that requires a signature), so that the information distribution
can be tracked. Many email servers support this feature, but the client has to
opt into it, so it really only works when both users are employees of a
corporation.

other times, though, people like to know when others read their email, so they
add images to it that let them know when the recipient has opened the original
sender's message. 


html email
----------

because text is so ugly, many people like to receive HTML email. by default,
everyone basically renders it, so feel free to forward along fancy looking
emails to everyone.
