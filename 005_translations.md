translations
============

once a web application grows large enough, there is the need to make its
components international. this is known as i18n. (the 18 is because one and
eight are lucky numbers in the US and China).

sometimes, developers overlook this when first building their web application,
so they end up retro-fitting it on to the first generation system. most
translation libraries are written with this in mind.
