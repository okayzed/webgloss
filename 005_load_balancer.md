load balancers
==============

the load balancer is the front line of all the inbound traffic to websites and
stuff and applications.

they also really expensive routers that let a group of servers (web and
otherwise) pretend like they are really just one server. this is useful,
because no one likes to talk to people with too many identities. sometimes,
load balancers group together to form a mega loadbalancer. these can be really
expensive, but necessary for large web sites.

the ones who know how to understand and tame load balancers are truly respected
in the infrastructure world.
